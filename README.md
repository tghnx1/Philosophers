Philosophers üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüçù

An implementation of the classic Dining Philosophers problem for the 42 School
 curriculum.
The project explores multithreading, synchronization, and the challenges of avoiding deadlocks and race conditions.

üìñ Project Overview

Five philosophers sit at a round table. Each philosopher alternates between:

Thinking üß†

Eating üç¥ (requires two forks)

Sleeping üò¥

Rules:

A philosopher can only eat when holding both forks (left and right).

Forks are shared between neighbors.

Philosophers must avoid starvation and deadlock.

The simulation ends if a philosopher dies (fails to eat within time_to_die ms) or when all have eaten must_eat_count times (if provided).

‚öôÔ∏è Mandatory Part

Implemented in C with POSIX threads (pthreads).

No philosopher should starve.

Properly handle synchronization with mutexes.

Input validation.

üöÄ Bonus Part

Philosophers implemented using processes and semaphores.

Each philosopher is a separate process; forks are protected with semaphores.

üõ†Ô∏è Build
make            # builds the program
make clean      # removes object files
make fclean     # removes objects and binary
make re         # rebuild everything


Binary produced: ./philo

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [must_eat_count]

Arguments

number_of_philosophers (int > 0)

time_to_die (ms)

time_to_eat (ms)

time_to_sleep (ms)

must_eat_count (optional: stop when each philosopher ate N times)

Example
./philo 5 800 200 200


‚û°Ô∏è Runs with 5 philosophers:

die if not eating for 800ms

eating takes 200ms

sleeping takes 200ms

üßµ Implementation Notes

Mutexes for forks.

Separate threads for philosophers + one monitor thread to detect death.

Timestamps for precise timing.

Avoid busy waiting with usleep().

‚úÖ Learning Goals

Understand deadlocks and how to avoid them.

Practice with multithreading and synchronization primitives.

Write robust and efficient C code under strict coding rules.
